## Background



## The Data Cleaning Process



The different types of missing values (IAP, DK, NA) were replace with 'NA'. This was done by the following code:

'''{r}
happy <- readRDS("C:/Users/wogie/OneDrive/DS202/HAPPY.rds")
names(happy) = tolower(names(happy))

happy$polviews[happy$polviews %in% "IAP"] <- "NA"
happy$polviews[happy$polviews %in% "DK"] <- "NA"
happy$health[happy$health %in% "IAP"] <- "NA"
happy$health[happy$health %in% "DK"] <- "NA"
happy$finrela[happy$finrela %in% "IAP"] <- "NA"
happy$finrela[happy$finrela %in% "DK"] <- "NA"

'''
The following code is how I cast Variables into the correct type to make the data visualization process more straightforward.

'''{r}
happy$age[happy$age == '89 OR OLDER'] <- "89"
happy$happy = as.character(happy$happy)
happy$year = as.numeric(happy$year)
happy$age = as.numeric(happy$age)
happy$sex = as.character(happy$sex)
happy$marital = as.character(happy$marital)
happy$degree = as.character(happy$degree)
happy$finrela = as.character(happy$finrela)
happy$health = as.character(happy$health)
happy$wtssall = as.numeric(happy$wtssall)
happy$partyid = as.character(happy$partyid)
happy$polviews = as.character(happy$polviews)
'''

I decided that ordering all of the Factors according to age would make sense because it is a relevant characteristic for all other Factors.

'''{r}
library(tidyverse)

happyVSage = fct_reorder(happy$happy, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)
sexVSage = fct_reorder(happy$sex, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)
maritalVSage = fct_reorder(happy$marital, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)
degreeVSage = fct_reorder(happy$degree, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)
finrelaVSage = fct_reorder(happy$finrela, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)
healthVSage = fct_reorder(happy$health, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)
partyidVSage = fct_reorder(happy$partyid, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)
polviewsVSage = fct_reorder(happy$polviews, happy$age, .fun=median, .desc = FALSE)

## Data Exploration

## 1)

Two interesting variables in this set are Sex and Degree. The distributions of both are shown below in relation to another variable, Age. 

'''{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(happy, aes(year, fill = sex)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2) + labs(title="Histogram of Age by Sex", x="Year", y="Count")
'''


'''{r}
ggplot(happy, aes(degree, age)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Boxplot of Degree by Age")
'''


## 2)


'''{r}
ggplot(happy, aes(health, fill=happy)) + geom_bar(color="red", position="fill") + coord_flip() + labs(title = "Barchart of Health as it relates to Happiness", x="Health", y="Percentage")
'''


'''{r}
ggplot(happy, aes(age, color=happy)) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1) + labs(title = "Comparison of Happiness and Age", x="Age", y="Count")
'''


'''{r}
ggplot(happy, aes(marital, fill=happy)) + geom_bar(position="fill") + labs(title="Barchart of Happiness and Marital Status", y="percentage", x="Level of Happiness")
'''
 


## 3)
What did I learn from the dataset?
